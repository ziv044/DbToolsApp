# Story 3.4: SQL Server Metric Collection Queries

## Status: Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** optimized T-SQL queries for metric collection,
**so that** we gather useful data with minimal impact on target servers.

## Acceptance Criteria

| # | Criteria |
|---|----------|
| 1 | CPU utilization query using sys.dm_os_ring_buffers or sys.dm_os_sys_info |
| 2 | Memory utilization from sys.dm_os_sys_memory |
| 3 | Connection count from sys.dm_exec_connections |
| 4 | Batch requests/sec from sys.dm_os_performance_counters |
| 5 | Top wait stats from sys.dm_os_wait_stats (top 10 waits) |
| 6 | Disk I/O from sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats |
| 7 | All queries tested on SQL Server 2016, 2017, 2019, 2022 |
| 8 | Queries complete in <1 second on idle system |
| 9 | Queries require only VIEW SERVER STATE permission |
| 10 | Collection queries packaged as stored procedures in DbTools schema |

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Implement CPU query (AC: 1, 9)
- [ ] Task 2: Implement memory query (AC: 2)
- [ ] Task 3: Implement connection query (AC: 3)
- [ ] Task 4: Implement batch requests query (AC: 4)
- [ ] Task 5: Implement wait stats query (AC: 5)
- [ ] Task 6: Implement disk I/O query (AC: 6)
- [ ] Task 7: Create stored procedures (AC: 10)
- [ ] Task 8: Test on all SQL versions (AC: 7, 8)

## Dev Notes

### Metric Queries
```sql
-- CPU %
SELECT TOP 1
    SQLProcessUtilization as cpu_percent
FROM sys.dm_os_ring_buffers
WHERE ring_buffer_type = N'RING_BUFFER_SCHEDULER_MONITOR'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Memory
SELECT
    total_physical_memory_kb / 1024 as total_mb,
    (total_physical_memory_kb - available_physical_memory_kb) / 1024 as used_mb
FROM sys.dm_os_sys_memory;

-- Connections
SELECT COUNT(*) as connection_count
FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions
WHERE is_user_process = 1;

-- Batch Requests/sec
SELECT cntr_value as batch_requests
FROM sys.dm_os_performance_counters
WHERE counter_name = 'Batch Requests/sec';
```

## Testing

- Test each query returns expected format
- Test permission requirements
